# MISY866
Project for MISY866- Cook Book for Data Science Beginners
1.	Extract actionable knowledge about the crypto-currencies from trading data of various traders.
2.	Use knowledge of statistics and domain expertise to support our findings.

## Getting Started
* Install Anaconda as data science distribution platform, refer anaconda installation guide from https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html
* Learn to use Jupyter notebook for python coding from http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html
* Basic knowledge of Python libraries â€“ NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn from https://plot.ly/python/user-guide/ 

## Prerequisites
To run this project you need below softwares in your system.
* Anaconda should be installed
* Jupyter notebook
* For plotly use this command on anaconda command prompt: conda install -c plotly plotly

## Functional Requirements
My research showcases use of python by focussing on below questions about cryptocurrencies:
* Trends in high and low values of cryptocurrencies.
* Trends in pricing of five cryptocurrency exchanges involved in trading the cryptocurrencies.
* Impact of the trading volumes of the cryptocurrencies on their high prices using the volumefrom [Bitcoin traded] and volumeto[USD] values of the data.
* Other factors involved in impacting the values of the cryptocurrencies.

## Installation and Deployment
* Open your command line
* Create a new project folder
* Clone a Git repository in newly created project folder. Link :- https://github.com/TinaWadhwa/MISY866
* If git clone is successful (you will see hidden .git folder)
* Once you are at above path you will see BTC_ETH_COMPARE.ipynb file.
* Run the file
